    "### About the Dataset\n",
    "This dataset contains daily records of air pollutant concentrations collected over time, including PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and Ozone. It also logs the Air Quality Index (AQI), along with date (day, month, year) also includes number of holidays and weekday representation. It is ideal for developing models to predict AQI, study pollution patterns, and analyze the effects of temporal or holiday factors on air quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "Is more CO produced on average by the residents and businesses of the Delhi region on weekdays (numbered 1-5 on the table) or weekends (numbered 6-7)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from this table was collected throughout the span of 5 years, 2021 through 2025, measuring the air pollutant concentrations collected over time, including PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and Ozone. For the case of this study, we will only be focusing on the concentrations of CO. \n",
    "\n",
    "To accurately measure the difference in concentration of CO between weekdays and weekends, we're going to collect averages on days numbered 1-5 in the \"Days\" column and 6-7 in the \"Days\" column to properly account for days Monday-Friday and Saturday-Sunday, respectively. With this data, we're going to plot the distributions to make a decision on the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Null Hypothesis\n",
    "There is no difference in the proportion of CO emissions over time between the weekdays and weekends by the residents and businesses of the Delhi region."
